# C++ Module 05

This module introduces C++ exception handling. It covers the `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords for managing runtime errors, explores the standard exception hierarchy (e.g., `std::exception`), and practices creating custom exception classes. The goal is to write safer, more robust code that gracefully handles exceptional circumstances.
